\begin{abstract}
  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be an 8.4\,m optical survey telescope sited in Chile and capable of imaging the entire sky twice a week.
  The data rate of approximately 15\,TB per night and the requirements to both issue alerts on transient sources within 60 seconds of observing and also to create annual data releases means that automated data management systems and data processing pipelines are a key deliverable of the LSST construction project.
  The LSST data management software has been in development since 2004 and, like other software developed in that era such as CASA, is based on a C++ core with a Python control layer.
  The software consists of nearly quarter of a million lines of code covering the system from fundamental WCS and table libraries to pipeline environments and distributed process execution.

  The Astropy project began in 2011 as an attempt to bring together disparate open source Python projects and build a core standard infrastructure that can be used by and built upon by the astronomy community.
  This project has been phenomenally successful in the years since it has begun and has grown to be the de facto standard for Python software in astronomy.
  Astropy brings with it considerable expectations from the community on how astronomy Python software should be developed and it is clear that by the time LSST is fully operational in the 2020s many of the prospective users of the LSST software stack will assume that Astropy software will be integrated.

  In this paper we describe the overlap between the LSST science pipeline software and Astropy software and investigate areas where the LSST software provides new functionality.
  We also discuss the possibilities of re-engineering the LSST science pipeline software to build upon Astropy, including the option of contributing affiliated packages.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)\cite{2008arXiv0805.2366I} will be an 8.4\,m optical survey telescope sited in Chile\cite{2014SPIE.9145E..1AG} and capable of imaging the entire sky twice a week.
The data rate of approximately 15\,TB per night\footnote{See \url{http://lsst.org/scientists/keynumbers} for additional numbers.} and the requirements to both issue alerts on transient sources within 60 seconds of observing and also to create annual data releases means that automated data management systems and data processing pipelines are a key deliverable of the LSST construction project\cite{2016_adassxxv_O3-1}.

The difficulty of sharing code between telescopes has long been a topic of discussion in the astronomy software community\cite{1998ASPC..145..142M,1999ASPC..172...11E,2001ASSL..266..163S,2002SPIE.4844..321E}.
Historically there have been some successes in fundamental libraries, such as SOFA, CFITSIO and wcslib, and in environments, such as IRAF, AIPS and Starlink.
Despite these, there is still a tendency for a new project to embark on the creation of a new environment or software infrastructure if there are slight requirements mismatches and no external political will to adopt a specific software suite.
The growth in the Open Source software movement\cite{2006OpenSources} and recent explosion in support tools such as git and GitHub for code sharing\cite{2014IACWSLima}, makes the process of software reuse far easier than it has ever been.

The LSST data processing pipeline software has been in development since 2004\cite{2004AAS...20510811A,2010SPIE.7740E..15A,2016_adassxxv_P056} and during this 16 years of development much has changed in the Python, C++ and astronomy software world.


\section{The LSST Science Pipeline Software}

As with other software developed in the early 2000s, such as CASA\cite{2012ASPC..461..849P}, the LSST science pipeline software is based on a C++ core with a Python control layer.
The general layout of the code is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:layers}.
In this paper we focus on the algorithmic and framework code provided by the \texttt{afw} and \texttt{meas\_} packages as these are the packages that have most in common with the Astropy core package.
